TimeStamper
===========

Get time stamps into your clip board instantly.

This utility gives you quick access to time stamps.
You canconfigure what formats of time stamps you want and what prefix to use.
The time stamps can be used for example in file names for version control ( see http://filipkral.com/?page_id=369 )

To run Time Stamper, just dowload timestamper.py and double-click on it (or execute it in anyother way).
Provided you have Python installed properly, the Time Stamper dialog will open.
Define a prefix in the text box, and click on one of the buttons. The text from the button you clicked is copied into your clip board with the prefix you specified.
